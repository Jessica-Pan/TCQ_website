- inputting a list of team names for a game

## What you need to change

- Add a favicon to your website at the path client/dist/favicon.ico

## Socket stuff

Note: we'll be getting to this in lecture in week 2, so don't worry if you don't know it yet

- If you are using socket, consider what you want to do with the FIXME in server-socket.js
