## What needs to be done

- API stuff:
  - Posting the scores
  - getting the scores (exporting to a csv file)
- rn the grader's input doesn't actually go anywhere
- the whole socket thing with the student answers
- the proctor's ability to reset the timer for the students

## Known issues

- New-Game: If you change the number of questions, it should erase what's written in the boxes already
- also a lot of the css is mediocre

## Additional Features

- uploading an image into the question
- inputting a list of team names for a game

## What you need to change

- Add a favicon to your website at the path client/dist/favicon.icon

## Socket stuff

Note: we'll be getting to this in lecture in week 2, so don't worry if you don't know it yet

- If you are using socket, consider what you want to do with the FIXME in server-socket.js
