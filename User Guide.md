## Admin views. 

From the landing page, select admin. From here, you have several options: 

### 1. Create a new game. 

Select "New Game." Here, you'll be able to input the number of questions in your game as well as the list of student teams that are part of this game (with line breaks between each team name). 

Then, for each question, input the number of parts in the question and the amount of time that students get to answer the question. For each part, input the question text that will be displayed to students and the number of points that that question is worth. 

Once you're finished, select "Set Game" to view your final game info, including the game code, admin password, and each question password. You'll want to save the game code and admin password; with this information, you can see this page again in the game info screen. 

### 2. Proctor view

Input the game code and admin password and select "Proctor" from the role drop down menu. 

From here, you can see what time each team began the questions in your game. This way, you can determine if a team started before you expected them to. 

You can also reset the timer on any team that is currently in a room. Resetting the timer also clears any answer that they were working on at the time. 

### 3. Grader view

Once the students have submitted their answers, you can grade them through the grader's view. Input the game code and admin password, and select "Grader" from the role drop down menu. 

Select a question to grade at the top of the page. Then, you can see the question text, as well as the answers for every team that has submitted an answeer for that question. You can also see the current grade in the system for those answers. 

The grades that you input update automatically and can be seen by other graders working simultaneously. 

### 4. Game info

Input the game code and admin password and select "Game Info" from the role dropdown menu. 

From here, you can see all of the information for the game, including the passwords for each question.

You can also download a CSV of all of the grades in the system at the time after loading the grades. 

### Student Pages

From the landing page, select student. 

Then, input the game code (given to you by an admin) and select your team from the drop down menu of teams inputted by the admin. 

For each question, you will then be prompted for the question password. Once one student clicks okay, all students in that team are sent to the question page, where they can all type in the textbox, which will update in real time. 

Once the timer expires, their answer will be automatically uploaded, and the next question landing page will prompt them for the next question password.
